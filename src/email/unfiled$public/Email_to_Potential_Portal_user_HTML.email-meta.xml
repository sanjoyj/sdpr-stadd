    <textOnly>Hello,

You have been invited by a Navigator with the STADD Program (Services to Adults with Developmental Disabilities) to become a user of our online planning and information sharing tool known as Collaborate. Collaborate allows members of a youthâ€™s support team to share information and create a transition plan in one online space.

Click this link to Register for Collaborate: http://developmental-disability-support.gov.bc.ca

Note: You must have either a government IDIR or a valid BCeID to register for Collaborate. If you need a BCeID, click the &quot;Register for BCeID&quot; link in the upper right-hand corner of the webpage and register for a Basic BCeID.
